## Reviewer Comments

### Regarding examples (`\dontrun{}`)

> \dontrun{} should only be used if the example really cannot be executed... Please replace \dontrun with \donttest...,we still see \dontrun{} being used.

**My Response:**
I have reviewed all examples and use roxygen2 to make sure my Rd-files after altering.

Regarding the `NOTE` about a new maintainer, this is my first submission to CRAN.
